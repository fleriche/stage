	This document is an end-of-course internship report describing my work on the Digital Banking. The banking industry has been revolutionize by the new information technologies and is experiencing an upheaval. Many new contenders can now start trading and challenge larger companies by taking advantage of the digital innovation. These are agile and customer centric challengers using digital technologies to ensure highly secure banking services to their customers. In this report I will be describing my work on the digital transformation of two private banks : Neuflize OBC and Banque Privée 1818. These banks decided to use the services of Sopra Steria to be supported during their transformation process. The objective is to supply them with all banking elements they need focusing on the customer experience and regardless their stage of evolution. Whether they are new entrants or established banks we have to deliver them flex services which can scale and adapt to their needs as their operations grows. In my case, on one hand I worked on the backend developpement of an mobile application for Neuflize OBC. It was an REST API with microservices architecture developped using the Netflix open source stack. On the other hand, I worked on the developpement of a web application for Banque Privée 1818. Its backend is a REST API built with Spring Boot and its frontend is an Angular4 client developped with reactive programmation paradigm.
