	This document is an end-of-course internship report describing my work at Sopra Steria on the Digital Banking transformation. The banking industry has been revolutionized by the recent advances in information technology and is experiencing an upheaval. Many new contenders can now start trading and challenge larger companies by taking advantage of the digital innovation. They are agile and customer centric companies using digital technologies to ensure highly secure banking services to their customers. In this report I describe my work on the digital transformation of two private banks : Neuflize OBC and Banque Privée 1818. These banks decided to rely on Sopra Steria to guide them and drive their transformation process. The objective is to supply them with all banking elements they need focusing on the customer experience. Either working for new companies or longly established banks we must deliver them flex services which can scale and adapt to their needs as their operations grow. During my internship I worked on the backend developpement of an mobile application for Neuflize OBC. It was a REST API with microservices architecture developped using the Netflix open source stack. In parralel, I worked on the developpement of a web application for Banque Privée 1818. The backend is a REST API built with Spring Boot whereas the frontend is an Angular4 client both developped applying the reactive programmation paradigm.
